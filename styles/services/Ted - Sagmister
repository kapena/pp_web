Ted - Sagmister

Contentious mind 

Tiny rider on huge elephant, the rider thinks he can tell the elephant what to do but really the elephant has its own ideas. 

Thinking about ideas and content freely.

Traveling to new places.

Using a wide variety of tools and techniques.

Working on new projects that matter to me. 

Having things work.

Getting feedback from people who See's my work.

Designing a project that feels partly brand new and partly familiar.
